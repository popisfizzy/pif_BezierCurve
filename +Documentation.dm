  3. Introduction
  ----------------------------------------------------

  Bézier curves are smooth parametric curves in arbitrary dimensions generated by a collection of n
  points. Their 'nice' behavior gives them many uses in computer graphics, and on top of that they
  look quite good too. They can also be naturally transformed by linear maps (i.e., linear
  transformations or matrix transformations) by simply transforming the n sample points.

  At this time, this library provides no means to actually draw the curve or produce an image of the
  curve, and instead simply outputs a list of points which the programmer must use to draw lines
  between in order to approximate the curve.

  4. Example
  ----------------------------------------------------

  Below is an example of how one could use this library to draw a Bézier curve for nine points with
  a "smoothness" (see Section 4.) of 50, where the points are: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4),
  (5,3), (6,2), (7,1), (8,0). This is assuming we have a DrawLine() method available that takes two
  points and draws a line between them.

    var
        pif_BezierCurve/C = new(0,0 , 1,1 , 2,2 , 3,3 , 4,4 , 5,3 , 6,2 , 7,1 , 8,0)
        list/Curve

        last_x
        last_y

    C.Smoothness(50)
    Curve = C.Curve()

    last_x = Curve[1]
    last_y = Curve[2]

    for(var/i = 1, i < C.Smoothness(), i ++)
        var
            new_x = Curve[2*i+1]
            new_y = Curve[2*i+2]

        DrawLine(last_x,last_y , new_x,new_y)

        last_x = new_x
        last_y = new_y

  To see an example of what this Bézier curve looks like, refer to the hub.

  5. Preprocessors
  ----------------------------------------------------

  By default, the namespace of this library is prefixed, i.e. /pif_BezierCurve has the prefix pif_
  on it. This can be removed by either,

    1. Defining PIF_NOPREFIX_BEZIERCURVE, which will remove the prefix from only this library.
    2. Defining PIF_NOPREFIX_GENERAL, which will remove the prefix from this library and all others
       of mine that in the future will have similar prefixing.

  As expected, the unprefixed namespace is /BezierCurve

  There is also a PIF_BEZIERCURVE_INCLUDED flag defined, to allow for the optional inclusion of code
  depending on the presence of this library.

  6. The /pif_BezierCurve class
  ----------------------------------------------------

    +-------------------------------+
    |  Parent Class: /datum         |
    |  Namespace: /pif_BezierCurve  |
    |  File: pif_BezierCurve.dm     |
    +-------------------------------+

  The /pif_BezierCurve class is used to generate sample points to draw lines between in order to get
  an approximation of a Bézier curve.

    New()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        Either an list of arguments or a /list object, either of which must have an even length and
        contain only numeric data. The odd elements of these will refer to the x coordinates, and
        the even elements will refer to the y coordinates. The first pair is the first control point
        of the Bézier curve, the second pair the second control point, and so on.

        Note that the Bézier curve will always start on the first control point and end on the last
        point. The rest of the curve will be on or within the convex hull of the control points.

      Behavior.

        Populates the /pif_BezierCurve object with the sample points.

    AddPoint()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        A pair of numbers.

      Behavior.

        Adds the point indicated by the pair of numbers to the end of the points, making it the last
        control point.

      Returns.

        The new number of control points.

    Close()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        None.

      Behavior.

        "Closes" the Bézier curve by adding a new point equal to the last point. Because a Bézier
        curve always starts on its first control points and ends on its last control point, this
        will make the two coincide and the Bézier curve will have a well-defined interior.

      Returns.

        True, if the point was added (meaning the curve was not already closed) and false otherwise.

    Curve()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        * smoothness: An optional argument to superecede the default smoothness. This will not
            change the pif_BezierCurve object's smoothness value, and is only used once per call to
            Curve().

      Behavior.

        Generates the sample points used to draw an approximation of the Bézier curve.

      Returns.

        A list of length 2*Smoothness() (i.e., of the number of sample points indicated by
        Smoothness()). This is the sample points to draw lines between, where the first sample point
        is the same as the first control point, and the last sample point is the same as the last
        control point. The odd terms are the x-coordinates of the sample points, and the even terms
        are the y-coordinates of the sample points.

    FirstPoint()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        None.

      Returns.

        A /list element whose first element is the x-coordinate of the first control point and whose
        second element is the y-coordinate of the first control point.

    InsertPoint()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        * p: An integer whose absolute value is between 1 and Length() (refer below for this
            method). Positive values meaure from the first control point (i.e., p = 1 means the
            first control point) while negative values measure from the last control point (i.e.,
            p = -1 means the last control point.
        * x: The x-coordinate of the control point to be added.
        * y: The y-coordinate of the control point to be added.

      Behavior.

        Inserts the control point (x,y) into the control points at the position specified by p.

      Returns.

        The new number of control points.

    LastPoint()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        None.

      Returns.

        A /list element whose first element is the x coordinate of the last control point and whose
        second element is the y coordinate of the last control point.

    Length()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        None.

      Returns.

        A natural number, the number of control points.

    NudgePoint()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        * p:  An integer whose absolute value is between 1 and Length() (refer below for this
            method). Positive values meaure from the first control point (i.e., p = 1 means the
            first control point) while negative values measure from the last control point (i.e.,
            p = -1 means the last control point.
        * dx: The amount to add to the x coordinate of the point at position p.
        * dy: The amount to add to the y coordinate of the point as position p.

      Behavior.

        This adds (dx,dy) to the point (x,y) at position p.

      Returns.

        True on success.

    Open()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        None.

      Behavior.

        "Opens" the Bézier curve by deleting the last control point if it was equal to the first
        control point. This will make the curve "open" and have no well-defined interior.

      Returns.

        True, if the point was deleted (meaning the curve was not already open) and false otherwise.

    Point()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        * p: An integer whose absolute value is between 1 and Length() (refer below for this
            method). Positive values meaure from the first control point (i.e., p = 1 means the
            first control point) while negative values measure from the last control point (i.e.,
            p = -1 means the last control point.

      Returns.

        A /list object, whose first element is the x-coordinate of the control point at position p
        and whose second element is the y-coordinate of the control point at position p.

    RemovePoint()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        * p: An integer whose absolute value is between 1 and Length() (refer below for this
            method). Positive values meaure from the first control point (i.e., p = 1 means the
            first control point) while negative values measure from the last control point (i.e.,
            p = -1 means the last control point.

      Behavior.

        Removes the control point at position p.

      Returns.

        The new number of control points.

    Smoothness()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        * s: The new "smoothness". Defaults to the current smoothness.

      Behavior.

        Sets the smoothness of the output curve. This refers to the total number of sample points
        that will be generated and thus is 1/2 the length of the output list of the Curve()
        function. Higher values of smoothness result in a smoother-looking curve, hence the name.

      Returns.

        The current smoothness.

    Transform()
    --------------------

      Arguments.

        Takes either a matrix, or a list or argument list of six numeric values (the same one would
        use to construct a matrix).

      Behavior.

        Applies the transformation to all the provided control points.

      Returns.

        True.

  - Initial release.

  8. To Do/Plans
  ----------------------------------------------------

  * Implement curve drawing and color curve transformation, if and when DM gets native line
    primitives.

  * Implement an adaptive subclass, which selects more sample points from regions of the curve that
    have a higher curvature. This would be more processor-intensive in selecting the points (it
    requires sampling more points and computing the derivatives to find the curvature) but it would
    be quicker to draw and likely look smoother with fewer sample points.
